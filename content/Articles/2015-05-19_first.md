Summary: Testing blog

Hello World,

Welcome to the first entry of my Pelican powered blogging adventures! You will find many interesting things in this space, including general computing tips, code snippets, research progressions and projects I have been working on or found useful throughout my PhD in next generation computational modelling... For now though, please bare with the mandatory theme testers and trial blog entries as I adapt to the Pelican way of life.

Things can only get better!
