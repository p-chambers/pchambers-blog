This blog is written by Paul Chambers. I am currently a postgraduate research student in the EPSRC [Centre for Doctoral Training in Next Generation Computational Modelling](http://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk/) at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), with a background in aerodynamics.

My current research interests are in machine learning algorithms as a means for aircraft design layout optimisation. I'm also passionate about software engineering, and spend probably too much time doing/caring/thinking about best practices for applied scientific software development.

This blog is designed to keep an electronic record of the tips, tools and projects I have generated or acquired throughout my PhD. Content presented here is my own unless otherwise stated - suggested improvements are welcome.
